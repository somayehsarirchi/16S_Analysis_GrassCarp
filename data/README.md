# Input Data Description

This analysis uses publicly available 16S rRNA sequencing data from the NCBI SRA:

- **BioProject**: [PRJNA1293113](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1293113)
- **Fish Species**: Grass Carp (_Ctenopharyngodon idella_)
- **Sample Groups**: Diet-treated vs. Control
- **Accession IDs**:  
  - **Diet**:  SRR34584690 â€“ SRR34584696, SRR34584698- SRR34584699   
  - **Control**: SRR34584697, SRR34584700 â€“ SRR34584701 

Raw FASTQ files were downloaded using the `prefetch` and `fasterq-dump` tools from the SRA Toolkit.
